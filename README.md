# Top-Down-Game-Prototype
This is a simple top-down Java game created as a personal project to explore and practice core 2D game development concepts.
## About

The player controls a character that can walk around a tile-based world. The game includes:

- A world built using a tileset
- Basic movement and input handling
- Collision detection with world objects
- Rendering distance (only part of the map is visible at a time)
- Collectable items (like a key and a chest)

There are no enemies or goalsâ€”this project is mainly a sandbox for testing and learning.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- Graphics: Custom rendering with `Graphics2d`
- Input: Keyboard (WASD)
- No external game engine used

## Goals of the Project

This game was made to practice:

- Building a tile-based world
- Implementing a camera/viewport system
- Coding player movement and collision logic
- Creating interactable items
- Basic game rendering loop

## Future Ideas (Optional)

- Add a menu or restart system
- Expand the map and add transitions between areas
- Add simple NPCs and enemies
- Sound effects or background music

Made as a learning project.
